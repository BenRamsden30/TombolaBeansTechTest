I chose a blazor application with an MVC style approach to allow for simple and easy scalability and to allow it 
to dynamically adapt to different devices ranging from desk tops to mobiles,

I chose to refresh the bean of the day on each request as to show the feature, this would be easily changed to be 
updated at midnight each day instead,

Generate my own CoffeBeans.json as one was not sent with the task document,

Time constraints and sickness have left it in a semi finished stage currently, issues are:
- Using Href to redirect over actual buttons for navigation,
- Binding for the drop down on the order form is not working,
- Data once selected and "Order placed" does not do anything with the information provided

Improvements that i would make:
- Add testing,
- Fix the above mentioned problems,
- Add additional data handling,
- Improve styling in the CSS files,
- Addition of the 2nd portion of the task
